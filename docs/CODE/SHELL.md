# Shell Standards

Shell-specific standards covering both interactive shell commands and scripts. The general coding standards in @~/.claude/docs/CODING.md apply on top of these; this document does not repeat cross-language rules.

Most rules apply equally to one-shot commands typed at the prompt and to scripts. The Mandatory Safety Header, Portability, Error Handling traps, and Schedulers sections are script-specific and noted as such; everything else applies universally.

## Version Targeting

bash 5+ for all projects. Associative arrays, `[[ =~ ]]` regex with `BASH_REMATCH`, `mapfile`/`readarray`, advanced parameter expansion, and `${var^^}` case conversion are permitted and encouraged where they improve clarity.

If a script genuinely must run on stock macOS bash 3.2 (rare: a Homebrew bootstrap script or similar), declare the requirement explicitly with a comment at the top of the file. Otherwise, scripts may rely on bash 5+ features freely. Public Homebrew formulae should `depends_on "bash"`.

## Mandatory Safety Header (scripts)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
```

Omit only with documented reason. Does not apply to one-shot commands at the prompt.

**`IFS=$'\n\t'` is forbidden.** The third leg of "Bash Strict Mode" is actively harmful in a codebase that already mandates quoted variables and array-based command construction (see Required Practices below). It introduces bugs into correctly-written shell -- `read A B C < <(cmd)` against space-separated tool output, `read -ra arr <<< "$line"` for intentional word-splitting, parsing of `stty size` / `wc -l` / `df` / version strings, and most interop with CLI tools that emit space-separated values. The only thing it defends against is the unquoted-variable anti-pattern this document already prohibits. Do not add it to the safety header; if a script needs different word-splitting in a specific block, set `IFS` locally for that block and restore it afterwards.

## Required Practices

- Quote variables: `"$var"`
- Terminate options: `trash -- "$file"`
- Use arrays for command construction, not strings
- Use `command -v`, not `which`
- Never parse `ls`
- `find` pipelines: `-print0` with `read -r -d ''` or `xargs -0`
- All CLI executables must provide `-h`/`--help` and `--version`. Provide `--dry-run` where appropriate
- If releasing on Homebrew, always `make release` then install locally via `brew install` or `upgrade` -- never live-patch an existing package install from brew or any other package manager

## Prohibited Shell Patterns

Never execute code from strings or discovery:

- `$cmd` / `"$cmd"` / `${cmd}` as commands
- `eval` (any use)
- String concatenation to build and run commands
- Running scripts found via `find` or globbing
- Wiring discovered paths into schedulers or services

## Safe Alternatives

- Functions or `case` dispatch for behaviour selection
- Bash array for dynamic commands: `cmd=(git status --porcelain); "${cmd[@]}"`
- Script selection: allowlist by name, validate against `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$`, verify exists/executable/permissions

## Arithmetic Expression Gotcha

The `(( ))` construct returns exit code 1 when the expression evaluates to 0, triggering `set -e`. The `let` builtin has the same behaviour. Never suppress this with `|| true`.

```bash
# BAD: suppresses the exit code problem
((count++)) || true
((count++)) || :
let count++ || true

# GOOD: arithmetic expansion in assignment (always succeeds)
count=$((count + 1))

# GOOD: null command consumes the expression (always succeeds)
: $((count++))

# GOOD: declare as integer, then use +=
declare -i count=0
count+=1
```

## Data Handling

**Use format-aware tools to read or modify structured data.** Parsing JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, HTML, or program output with grep/sed/awk/perl is brittle and prone to corrupting structure.

**Never modify data using sed, awk, perl, or any line-based stream editor.** `perl -pi -e` and `perl -ne` are sed with extra steps and fall under the same prohibition. For source code, use direct editing or `ast-grep` (`sg`) for cross-file structural refactors. For structured data, use the tools in the table below. For plaintext, use direct editing.

**`grep` is for plaintext streams or files where a newline character is the delimiter** -- logs, command output, single-file pattern matches. **`ripgrep` (`rg`) is for finding files**, not for extracting content. In shell scripts, the only routine use of `rg` is `rg -l` to enumerate files for further processing by a format-aware tool. Reaching for `rg` to pull content out of a file is usually a sign the wrong tool is being used downstream.

Tests must never pass by grepping or otherwise introspecting source code -- see @~/.claude/docs/TESTING.md.

### Tools

| Format | Tool | Brew package | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source code (structural refactor) | `ast-grep` (`sg`) | `ast-grep` | Preferred for bulk renames and signature changes across files. Single-file edits: direct editing is fine. |
| JSON | `jq` | `jq` | The standard. |
| YAML | `yj \| jq` | `yj` + `jq` | Default. Converts YAML to JSON then queries with jq. One query language, no naming conflict. |
| YAML (in-place edit preserving comments) | `yq` (Mike Farah) | `yq` | Reserved for cases where comments and anchors must survive the edit. v4+. Verify install: `yq --version 2>&1 \| grep -q mikefarah`. |
| TOML | `dasel` | `dasel` | |
| XML | `xmlstarlet` | `xmlstarlet` | For edit/validate. `dasel` acceptable for simple reads. |
| HTTP / API content | `curl \| jq` | `curl` + `jq` | Standard pattern for fetching and processing API responses, including in tests. |
| Format conversion | `yj` | `yj` | YAML ↔ TOML ↔ JSON ↔ HCL |
| CLI output -> JSON | `jc` | `jc` | Wrap `ps`/`df`/`mount`/`netstat`/etc. before parsing. |
| Multi-format | `dasel` | `dasel` | One selector syntax across JSON/YAML/TOML/XML/CSV. |

For HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tooling (htmlq, htmltest, stylelint, eslint) see @~/.claude/docs/CODE/WEB.md.

### yq pitfall

Two unrelated tools share the name `yq`:

- Mike Farah's (Go, dominant) -- `mikefarah/yq`
- Kislyuk's (Python, jq wrapper) -- `kislyuk/yq`

Their syntaxes are incompatible. Any script depending on `yq` must verify the right one is installed:

```bash
if ! yq --version 2>&1 | grep -q 'mikefarah'; then
    echo "Requires mikefarah/yq v4+" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

Prefer the `yj | jq` pipeline above to avoid the naming conflict entirely.

### Data Format Policy

| Use case | Format |
|---|---|
| Plaintext data -- newline-delimited streams or files (logs, command output) | Read with `grep`; never modify with sed/awk/perl |
| Program data persisted to disk or emitted for another program to consume | **JSON** |
| User-authored configuration | **YAML** (nested) |
| User-authored tabular data | **CSV** |
| Output a human will read directly (status, summaries, reports) | **YAML** rendered from program data at the display boundary |
| Externally-standardized formats (`pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, GitHub workflows, etc.) | Follow upstream |

User config is parsed into the language's native types at load time and must not depend on YAML features that have no JSON equivalent (anchors with side effects, complex tags, non-string keys) -- this keeps configs portable and prevents loader-specific behaviour.

## Portability

- Cross-platform Darwin/Linux where feasible
- `#!/usr/bin/env` shebangs
- Handle macOS paths (`~/Library`, etc.)
- Consider ARM64 quirks
- Prefer Unix built-ins (exceptions: coreutils, ast-grep)

## Error Handling

The general principles (fail fast, fail loud, fail safe; exit codes 0/1/2; errors to stderr) are in @~/.claude/docs/CODING.md. Shell-specific patterns:

- Validate inputs early; reject bad data at the boundary
- Clean up resources on failure using traps:

```bash
cleanup() {
    # remove temp files, close connections, etc.
}
trap cleanup EXIT
```

## File Operations

- Use `trash` instead of `rm` to allow recovery
  - **Exception:** temporary files and directories created for the sole purpose of a single operation may be deleted directly in cleanup/teardown logic rather than trashed
- Atomic writes: write to temp, then `mv`
- Use `flock` when multiple processes may write

## Schedulers and Services

For systemd, launchd, cron:

- Never generate definitions from runtime discovery (unless job-dedicated directory with validated scripts)
- Use build/install-time path resolution
- `ExecStart=` must use absolute, fixed paths
- Avoid `sh -c`/`bash -c` in units; pass arguments directly
- Logs must go somewhere predictable; failures must be visible
