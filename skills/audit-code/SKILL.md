description: Review implementation code against CODING.md and language best practice. Advisory only -- no file changes.
---

Review the implementation code for the current issue. Do not modify any files.

1. **Standards check.** Review all changed files against CODING.md and against best practice for the language(s) and stack(s) in use. CODING.md cannot enumerate patterns for every language -- apply community standards, idioms, and known pitfalls for this specific ecosystem alongside our own rules.

2. **Error handling.** Check every error path. Is each failure either a hard fail (let it crash) or properly handled with conditional logic? Flag any error suppression patterns (`|| true`, `|| rc=$?`, `set +e`, bare `except`, empty `catch`, etc.).

3. **Security.** Check for OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, hardcoded credentials, injection risks, overly permissive permissions.

4. **Complexity.** Flag functions over 50 lines, nesting deeper than 3 levels, god objects, duplicated code.

5. **Summarize.** List all findings with file paths and line numbers. Categorize as blockers (must fix) or smells (worth discussing). Recommend specific fixes for each finding.

Do not proceed past this audit. Wait for my response.
